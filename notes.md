Basics of JS (Collections, Variables, Functions)


Common collection methods:

.forEach => iterating over an array and performing some logic at each index
.map => iterate over an array producing a new array where each item is transformed based on the logic provided

.filter => iterates over an array producing a new array with only the items that pass your criteria

.find => iterates over an array and spits out the first match of the criterion provided
